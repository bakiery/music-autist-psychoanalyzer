# music-autist-psychoanalyzer

**A clinically autistic, meme-tier psychoanalysis engine that brutally roasts your entire existence based solely on your raw Spotify or Last.fm data.**  
No HR-safe answers. No LinkedIn diversity-washing. Just savage, data-driven truth and neurotic, hyper-detailed judgment‚Äîpowered by open GPT-OSS 20B.

---

## üö© What does it do?

- **You dump your music taste** (Spotify/Last.fm top tracks, genres, playlists, scrobbles, etc). For example, to get your raw Spotify data for the past 1 month, 6 month or 12 months, get it from here: http://favoritemusic.guru
- The model **diagnoses** you: age, gender, neurotype, likelihood of LGBTQ+, DSM-5 traits, political leanings, MBTI/Socionics/Enneagram, archetype (both IRL and online), and exactly who you mog/who mogs you in terms of social status and SES.
- **Output is a full psycho-meme roast.** Not for normies, LinkedIn clout-chasers, or anyone allergic to reality.

## ü¶æ Why is this different?

- **No filter, no cope:** Roasts you using raw, clinical, non-PC logic.
- **Savage as fuck:** If you‚Äôre a ‚Äúmidwest emo femboy‚Äù or a ‚Äúcyber-goth meme alchemist,‚Äù it‚Äôll tell you.
- **Gen Z/Terminally Online POV:** Knows your Discord servers, TikTok meme diet, and 4chan /mu/ browsing history.
- **Actually uses LLMs:** Demo runs GPT-OSS-20B locally via Ollama (or swap for smaller models if you hate your MacBook).
